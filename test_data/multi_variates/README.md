# Process Type: multi\_variates

'multi\_variates' means:

- More than 2 covariates

See code in `get_MajorMinor()` and `get_process_type()`.

The 'pdata\_time-series.csv' file uses Time as the fourth covariate.

**NOTE**: when running a multi\_variates report, ensure all of the desired
covariates are checked in the table on the report generation page.
