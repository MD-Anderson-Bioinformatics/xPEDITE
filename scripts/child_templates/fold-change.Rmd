## Fold Change

Fold change allows the user to comprehensively identify significantly modulated metabolites based on biological
significance. The table is highly dynamic. You can use the dropdown buttons to choose the covariate, groups to
compare, and additional comparison parameters in the 'limit comparison' dropdown. The data can also be
downloaded from the table.
