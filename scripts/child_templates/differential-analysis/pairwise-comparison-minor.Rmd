### Pairwise Comparison Between `r minor` {.tabset .tabset-fade}

ANOVA was performed for all pairs of samples. FDR-adjusted p-values across all metabolites were calculated and visualized
as a dot plot. Metabolites with a p-value less than this displayed cutoff are shown in the dot plot.
Complete ANOVA results of all metabolites can be obtained from the Table (Data matrix tab). Dot plots and data
matrix tables are interactive. Column names indicate the compared pairwise comparison. The dot size represents
the significance based on the adjusted p-value. There are a variety of buttons on the header bar to manipulate the
dot plot view. One can zoom, pan, and download the plot.

Difference of abundance between normalized intensities of two groups, upper and lower confidence interval along with
respective p-values for each combination are listed in the table. ANOVA is separately performed for each treatment
group. Adj.Pvalues represent the pvalue of each time-point comparison adjusted across other pairwise comparison in a
single treatment group. FDR corrected P-values across all compounds are also added to the table
