## Data Table

The data table provides normalized metabolite relative abundance. The tables are interactive and each column can be
sorted in ascending or descending order. Users can search for a specific metabolite using the search bar and copy
or download the data in CSV or Excel format.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
colnames <- colnames(df)
# Reorder Primary Pathway to the front
if ("Primary Pathway" %in% colnames) {
  colnames <- colnames[!colnames %in% c("Primary Pathway")]
  colnames <- c("Primary Pathway",colnames)
  df <- df[, colnames]
}
# Get a version of df without the refmet names to display in the data table. Keep the version with refmet names for use later in the report.
df_noRefmet <- df
if ("refmetName" %in% colnames) {
  colnames <- colnames[!colnames %in% c("refmetName")]
  df_noRefmet <- df[,colnames]
  colnames <- c("refmetName",colnames)
  df <- df[, colnames]
}
generate_dataTable(df_noRefmet)
```
