**Z-Score  Normalization**: The peak area (raw relative abundance) of each metabolite is z-score normalized: (<i>x</i><sub>metabolite,sample</sub> -
<i><mathml><mi>&#956;</mi></mathml></i><sub>metabolite</sub>) / <i><mathml><mi>&#963;</mi></mathml></i><sub>metabolite</sub>.
The means, <i><mathml><mi>&#956;</mi></mathml></i>, and standard deviations, <i><mathml><mi>&#963;</mi></mathml></i>,
are taken across samples.
