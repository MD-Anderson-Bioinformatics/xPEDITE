## Polar metabolite profiling by HILIC-MS

To determine the relative abundance of polar metabolites, extracts were prepared and analyzed by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Metabolites were extracted using ice-cold 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile: water = 90:10. Extracts were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 5 min at 4°C, and supernatants were transferred to autosampler injection vials for LCMS analysis. HILIC mobile phase A (MPA; Strong) was 20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in water:acetonitrile = 95:5, and mobile phase B (MPB; week) was acetonitrile. A Thermo Dionex Vanquish LC system included an Xbridge BEH amide column (3.5 µm particle size, 100 x 4.6 mm) with column compartment set at 35°C. The autosampler tray was chilled to 4°C. The mobile phase flow rate was 300 µL/min, and the gradient elution program was: 0-3 min, 85% MPB; 3-10 min, 85-30% MPB; 10-20 min, 30-2% MPB; 20-25 min, 2% MPB; 26-30 min, 2-85% MPB. The total run time was 30 min. Data were acquired using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 240 Mass Spectrometer under ESI positive and negative (polarity switching) ionization mode at a resolution of 240,000 with a scan range of 70-1000 m/z. All raw data files were imported into Compound Discoverer software for processing. The relative abundance (peak area) of each metabolite was normalized by total peak intensity.
